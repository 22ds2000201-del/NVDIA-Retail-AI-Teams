# U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Overview

## Introduction

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission), established by Congress in 1972, is an independent federal regulatory agency charged with reducing unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products.

## Mission and Goals

The CPSC achieves that goal through education, safety standards activities, regulation, and enforcement of the statutes and implementing regulations.

The CPSC has jurisdiction over thousands of types of consumer products used in the home, in schools, in recreation, or otherwise.

## Legislative Authority

To carry out its mission, CPSC administers seven statutes passed by Congress (the Acts). They are:

1. **Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA)** - The primary statute establishing the CPSC
2. **Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA)** - Regulates hazardous household products
3. **Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA)** - Sets flammability standards for clothing and textiles
4. **Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA)** - Requires child-resistant packaging
5. **Refrigerator Safety Act (RSA)** - Prevents child entrapment hazards
6. **Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act (VGB Act)** - Pool and spa drain safety
7. **Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act (CGBPA)** - Regulates portable fuel containers
